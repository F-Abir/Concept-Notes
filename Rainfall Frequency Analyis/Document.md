Rainfall Frequency Analysis

Extreme rainfall frequency analysis is a cornerstone of hydrological design, particularly for infrastructure such as dams, embankments, drainage systems, and urban stormwater networks. Several statistical methods are commonly employed to estimate design rainfall associated with specified return periods. These methods differ in their assumptions regarding distributional form, tail behavior, data requirements, and suitability for extrapolation. The following provides a comparative overview of four key approaches.
