1. Neural Networks (ANN - Artificial Neural Networks)
How it works: Layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information. Each connection has a weight that gets adjusted during training.
Best for: General pattern recognition, classification, regression when you have lots of data.

2. CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
How it works: Special neural network that uses "filters" to scan across images, detecting features like edges, shapes, then combining them to recognize objects.
Best for: Image recognition, video analysis, any spatial data. The gold standard for computer vision tasks.

3. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
How it works: Specialized neural network with "memory cells" that can remember or forget information over long sequences. Has gates that control what information flows through.
Best for: Time series prediction, text generation, speech recognition, any sequential data where context from earlier in the sequence matters.

4. ConvLSTM
How it works: Combines CNN and LSTM - processes spatial information (like images) AND temporal sequences together.
Best for: Video prediction, weather forecasting from satellite imagery, any task involving sequences of images.

5. Decision Trees
How it works: Creates a tree of yes/no questions about features. Like a flowchart - "Is age > 30?" → Yes → "Is income > 50k?" → Yes → Result.
Best for: Interpretable models where you need to explain decisions, works well with mixed data types, handles non-linear relationships naturally.

6. Random Forests
How it works: Creates hundreds of decision trees, each trained on random subsets of data. Final prediction is the vote/average of all trees.
Best for: Robust predictions, handling missing data, feature importance analysis. One of the best "general purpose" algorithms - works well on many problems without much tuning.

7. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
How it works: Finds the best boundary (hyperplane) that separates different classes with maximum margin. Can use "kernel tricks" to handle non-linear boundaries.
Best for: Small to medium datasets, high-dimensional data, binary classification. Works great when you have clear separation between classes.

8. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
How it works: To classify a new point, look at the K closest training examples and take a vote. No training phase - just stores all data.
Best for: Small datasets, recommendation systems, anomaly detection. Simple but can be slow for large datasets.

9. K-Means
How it works: Clustering algorithm that groups data into K clusters. Iteratively assigns points to nearest cluster center, then recalculates centers.
Best for: Customer segmentation, image compression, finding natural groupings in unlabeled data. Note: This is unsupervised learning (no labels needed).

10. Minimum Distance Classifier
How it works: Calculates the center (mean) of each class, then classifies new points based on which center they're closest to.
Best for: Simple, fast classification when classes are roughly spherical and well-separated. Good baseline model.

11. Maximum Likelihood
How it works: Assumes data follows a probability distribution (often Gaussian). Classifies based on which class makes the observation most "likely" given the distribution parameters.
Best for: When you have good understanding of underlying data distributions, medical diagnosis, statistical modeling.

12. Linear Regression
How it works: Fits a straight line (or hyperplane) through data to predict continuous values: y = mx + b.
Best for: Predicting continuous values, understanding relationships between variables, when relationships are roughly linear.
