1. Neural Networks (ANN - Artificial Neural Networks)
How it works: Layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information. Each connection has a weight that gets adjusted during training.
Best for: General pattern recognition, classification, regression when you have lots of data.

2. CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
How it works: Special neural network that uses "filters" to scan across images, detecting features like edges, shapes, then combining them to recognize objects.
Best for: Image recognition, video analysis, any spatial data. The gold standard for computer vision tasks.

3. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
How it works: Specialized neural network with "memory cells" that can remember or forget information over long sequences. Has gates that control what information flows through.
Best for: Time series prediction, text generation, speech recognition, any sequential data where context from earlier in the sequence matters.

4. ConvLSTM
How it works: Combines CNN and LSTM - processes spatial information (like images) AND temporal sequences together.
Best for: Video prediction, weather forecasting from satellite imagery, any task involving sequences of images.

5. Decision Trees
How it works: Creates a tree of yes/no questions about features. Like a flowchart - "Is age > 30?" → Yes → "Is income > 50k?" → Yes → Result.
Best for: Interpretable models where you need to explain decisions, works well with mixed data types, handles non-linear relationships naturally.

6. Random Forests
How it works: Creates hundreds of decision trees, each trained on random subsets of data. Final prediction is the vote/average of all trees.
Best for: Robust predictions, handling missing data, feature importance analysis. One of the best "general purpose" algorithms - works well on many problems without much tuning.

7. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
How it works: Finds the best boundary (hyperplane) that separates different classes with maximum margin. Can use "kernel tricks" to handle non-linear boundaries.
Best for: Small to medium datasets, high-dimensional data, binary classification. Works great when you have clear separation between classes.

8. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
How it works: To classify a new point, look at the K closest training examples and take a vote. No training phase - just stores all data.
Best for: Small datasets, recommendation systems, anomaly detection. Simple but can be slow for large datasets.

9. K-Means
How it works: Clustering algorithm that groups data into K clusters. Iteratively assigns points to nearest cluster center, then recalculates centers.
Best for: Customer segmentation, image compression, finding natural groupings in unlabeled data. Note: This is unsupervised learning (no labels needed).

10. Minimum Distance Classifier
How it works: Calculates the center (mean) of each class, then classifies new points based on which center they're closest to.
Best for: Simple, fast classification when classes are roughly spherical and well-separated. Good baseline model.

11. Maximum Likelihood
How it works: Assumes data follows a probability distribution (often Gaussian). Classifies based on which class makes the observation most "likely" given the distribution parameters.
Best for: When you have good understanding of underlying data distributions, medical diagnosis, statistical modeling.

12. Linear Regression
How it works: Fits a straight line (or hyperplane) through data to predict continuous values: y = mx + b.
Best for: Predicting continuous values, understanding relationships between variables, when relationships are roughly linear.

1. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
How it works: Builds trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects errors from previous ones. Combines many weak learners into a strong one.
Best for: Tabular data competitions (Kaggle winner!), structured data. Often outperforms Random Forests.

2. Naive Bayes
How it works: Uses Bayes' theorem to calculate probability of each class. Assumes features are independent (naive assumption).
Best for: Text classification, spam filtering, fast training with limited data.

3. Logistic Regression
How it works: Despite the name, it's for classification! Uses sigmoid function to predict probability of classes.
Best for: Binary classification, when you need probabilities, interpretable models, baseline comparisons.

4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
How it works: Dimensionality reduction - finds the most important directions (components) in high-dimensional data.
Best for: Reducing features before modeling, visualization, removing noise, handling multicollinearity.

5. Autoencoders
How it works: Neural network that compresses data into lower dimension then reconstructs it. Learns efficient representations.
Best for: Dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, denoising, feature learning.

6. Transformers (BERT, GPT, Attention mechanisms)
How it works: Uses "attention" to focus on relevant parts of input. Processes sequences in parallel (unlike LSTM's sequential processing).
Best for: Modern NLP (language models like ChatGPT), machine translation, any sequence modeling. Has largely replaced LSTMs.

7. Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning, DQN, PPO)
How it works: Agent learns by trial-and-error through rewards/penalties. Learns optimal actions in an environment.
Best for: Game playing, robotics, autonomous systems, resource optimization.

8. Gaussian Processes
How it works: Non-parametric Bayesian approach. Defines distribution over functions, provides uncertainty estimates.
Best for: Small datasets where uncertainty matters, optimization, spatial modeling.

9. Ensemble Methods (Voting, Stacking, Blending)
How it works: Combines predictions from multiple models to improve performance.
Best for: Competition settings, critical applications, squeezing out extra performance.

10. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN - the basic version)
How it works: Neural network with loops allowing information persistence. LSTM is an improved version that solves RNN's vanishing gradient problem.
Best for: Less common now (LSTM/Transformers are better), but foundational for understanding sequential models.

11. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)
How it works: Two networks compete - Generator creates fake data, Discriminator tries to detect fakes. Both improve together.
Best for: Image generation, data augmentation, style transfer, creating synthetic data.

12. DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)
How it works: Clusters based on density of points. Can find arbitrary-shaped clusters and identify outliers.
Best for: Clustering when you don't know number of clusters, finding outliers, spatial data.
