Comprehensive Guide to Radar Remote Sensing Terms
I'll explain every term from this radar remote sensing quiz in detail, covering causes, solutions, and practical applications.
1. Microwave Frequencies and Cloud Transparency
What it means: Microwaves can penetrate clouds, unlike visible or infrared light.
Causes:

Microwave wavelengths (1mm to 1m) are much larger than water droplets in clouds (typically 5-100 micrometers)
When electromagnetic radiation encounters particles much smaller than its wavelength, scattering is minimal (Rayleigh scattering becomes negligible)
Cloud droplets simply don't interact significantly with these longer wavelengths

Practical Use:

All-weather imaging capabilities
Day and night operation
Monitoring tropical regions with persistent cloud cover
Disaster response when clouds obscure optical satellites
Agricultural monitoring in monsoon regions

Solution it provides: Overcomes the fundamental limitation of optical remote sensing systems that cannot see through clouds.

2. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
What it means: A radar imaging technique that synthesizes a large antenna aperture using the motion of the platform.
Key Resolution Principles:
Azimuth Resolution (along-track direction)

Independent of platform altitude
Depends on antenna length: Resolution ≈ L/2 (where L = physical antenna length)
Achieved by processing multiple radar pulses as the platform moves
The synthetic aperture length is inversely proportional to the Doppler frequency shift

Causes of resolution improvement:

As the radar platform moves, it collects data from multiple positions
These positions create a "synthetic" antenna much larger than the physical one
Signal processing combines these observations coherently

Ground Range Resolution vs. Slant Range Resolution
Slant Range Resolution:

The resolution measured along the line-of-sight from radar to target
Formula: ΔRs = c/(2B), where c = speed of light, B = bandwidth
Independent of altitude

Ground Range Resolution:

The resolution projected onto the ground surface
Formula: ΔRg = ΔRs/sin(θ), where θ = incidence angle
Dependent on incidence angle and therefore indirectly affected by altitude
Degrades at shallow incidence angles (near range)

Practical Use:

High-resolution imaging from space (down to ~1m resolution)
Terrain mapping
Displacement monitoring (earthquakes, landslides)
Ship detection and tracking
Ice flow monitoring


3. Radar System Operational Description
Three Critical Parameters:
Operating Frequency

Determines penetration capability and sensitivity to different features
X-band (8-12 GHz): High resolution, surface features, urban areas
C-band (4-8 GHz): Balanced, general purpose, moderate penetration
L-band (1-2 GHz): Vegetation penetration, soil moisture
P-band (0.3-1 GHz): Deep penetration, biomass estimation, sub-surface

Polarization Configuration

HH: Horizontal transmit, Horizontal receive - rough surfaces, ice
VV: Vertical transmit, Vertical receive - vegetation, water
HV/VH: Cross-polarized - volume scattering, vegetation structure
Quad-pol: All four combinations - complete scattering characterization

Range of Incidence Angles

Steep angles (20-30°): Better ground range resolution, more volume scattering
Shallow angles (45-60°): Enhanced surface features, layover in mountains
Affects what features are visible and how they appear

Practical Use:

Satellite mission planning (Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2, ALOS PALSAR)
Application-specific data selection
Change detection requires consistent configurations
Interferometry requires identical geometries


4. Speckle
What it means: A grainy, salt-and-pepper noise pattern inherent to all coherent imaging systems.
Causes:

Each resolution cell contains many small scatterers
Radar waves reflect from all these scatterers
The reflected waves have random phases
When they combine at the receiver, they interfere constructively or destructively
This creates random bright and dark spots

Mathematical Basis:

If N scatterers with random phases combine, the result follows a Rayleigh distribution
Standard deviation equals the mean (poor signal-to-noise ratio)
It's multiplicative noise, not additive

Solutions:

Multi-looking:

Average multiple independent observations
Trades resolution for reduced speckle
Speckle reduction factor = √N for N looks


Spatial Filtering:

Lee filter: preserves edges while smoothing homogeneous areas
Frost filter: adaptive based on local statistics
Gamma MAP filter: based on multiplicative noise model


Multi-temporal Filtering:

Average images from different dates
Requires registration
Preserves resolution better than spatial filters



Practical Use:

Image interpretation requires speckle management
Classification algorithms need speckle-reduced images
Change detection benefits from multi-temporal averaging
Interferometry uses speckle correlation


5. Scattering Coefficient (σ°, Sigma Naught)
What it means: A normalized measure of how much radar energy a surface scatters back to the sensor, independent of the radar system parameters.
Definition:
σ° = (4π × received power) / (transmitted power × area illuminated)
Causes of Variation:

Surface Roughness:

Smooth surfaces: low backscatter (specular reflection away from sensor)
Rough surfaces: high backscatter (diffuse scattering)
"Roughness" is relative to wavelength


Dielectric Properties:

High moisture content: higher backscatter
Dry materials: lower backscatter
Metal/water: very high backscatter


Geometry:

Incidence angle
Local slope
Structural orientation



Properties of Different Features:

Calm water: -25 to -30 dB (very low)
Bare soil (dry): -15 to -5 dB
Vegetation: -10 to -5 dB
Urban areas: -5 to +5 dB (very high)
Corner reflectors: +20 to +30 dB (extremely high)

Practical Use:

Surface classification
Soil moisture estimation
Crop type identification
Ice type discrimination
Oil spill detection (smooth water = low backscatter)
Flood mapping (water appears dark)


6. Side-Looking Geometry
What it means: The radar antenna points perpendicular to the flight direction, not straight down.
Causes/Reasons:

Azimuth-Range Ambiguity:

Nadir-looking radar cannot distinguish left from right
Points at equal distances on both sides would overlap
Side-looking resolves this ambiguity


Range Resolution Mechanism:

Resolution depends on timing differences
Objects at different ranges return echoes at different times
This only works looking to the side


Doppler Processing:

SAR processing relies on Doppler frequency shifts
These shifts are maximized perpendicular to flight direction
Allows synthetic aperture formation



Practical Implications:

Images show features from the side, not from above
Creates geometric distortions (layover, foreshortening, shadow)
Slope orientation affects visibility
Must consider look direction in interpretation

Solutions to Limitations:

Use ascending and descending passes for complete coverage
Combine with DEM to correct geometric distortions
Select appropriate look direction based on terrain


7. Polarization Vector
What it means: The direction in which the electric field oscillates as the electromagnetic wave propagates.
Fundamental Properties:

The polarization vector is perpendicular to the direction of propagation
For a plane wave, if propagation is in the z-direction:

Electric field can oscillate in x-direction (one polarization)
Electric field can oscillate in y-direction (other polarization)
Or any combination (elliptical polarization)



Types:

Linear Polarization:

Horizontal (H): parallel to ground
Vertical (V): perpendicular to ground
Electric field oscillates in one plane


Circular Polarization:

Right-hand circular (RHC)
Left-hand circular (LHC)
Electric field rotates


Elliptical Polarization:

General case
Electric field traces an ellipse



Practical Use:
Polarimetric SAR Applications:

Crop monitoring: Different polarizations penetrate differently through vegetation
Forest structure: HV is sensitive to volume scattering from branches
Ice type classification: Different ice types have distinct polarimetric signatures
Ship detection: Ships show strong cross-pol returns
Wetland mapping: Water-vegetation interactions create specific pol signatures

Target Decomposition:

Separate surface, volume, and double-bounce scattering
Freeman-Durden decomposition
Cloude-Pottier decomposition (H-A-α)


8. Microwave Energy from the Sun
What it means: Solar microwave radiation that reaches Earth's surface.
Reality:

Yes, it exists but at levels much lower than Earth's thermal emission
The sun emits across all wavelengths, including microwaves
However, at microwave frequencies, blackbody radiation from Earth dominates

Causes:

Planck's Law:

Peak emission wavelength inversely proportional to temperature
Sun (5800K): peak in visible spectrum
Earth (300K): peak in thermal infrared (~10 μm)
Both are weak microwave emitters


Intensity Comparison:

Earth's microwave emission: ~200-300 K brightness temperature
Solar microwave contribution at surface: ~1-10 K equivalent
Ratio: ~1:100 or less



Practical Implications:

Active radar doesn't care: It uses its own transmitted energy
Passive microwave sensors: Measure Earth's emission + tiny solar component
Atmospheric absorption: Reduces solar contribution further
No solar illumination needed: Radar works day and night equally well

Practical Use:

Understanding that radar is truly independent of solar illumination
Designing passive microwave radiometers (different from radar)
Solar microwave bursts can interfere with satellite communications but not significantly with Earth observation radar


9. Radar Range Equation and Distance Dependence
What it means: How received power decreases with distance to target.
The Radar Equation:
Pr = (Pt × G² × λ² × σ) / ((4π)³ × R⁴)
Where:

Pr = received power
Pt = transmitted power
G = antenna gain
λ = wavelength
σ = radar cross-section
R = range to target

Cause of R⁴ Dependence:

Transmission (R²):

Power spreads spherically from radar
At distance R, power density = Pt/(4πR²)
Inverse square law


Reflection and Return (R²):

Target scatters energy
Scattered energy spreads spherically back
At radar, power density decreases by another R²
Another inverse square law


Combined: R² × R² = R⁴

Practical Implications:
Problems:

Dramatic power loss with distance
Near-range targets can saturate receiver while far-range targets are weak
Dynamic range requirements are severe

Solutions:

Automatic Gain Control (AGC):

Increase receiver gain with time (range)
Compensates for R⁴ loss


Chirped Pulses:

Use pulse compression
Allows longer pulses (more energy) with good resolution


Multiple Looks:

Average multiple observations
Improves signal-to-noise ratio


High-Power Transmitters:

Space-based SARs use 1-5 kW
Some systems use phased arrays



Practical Use:

System design: determines maximum range
Radiometric calibration: must account for range dependence
Image processing: normalize for R⁴ effect
Understanding detection limits


10. Polarization Configuration Notation
What it means: Describes both the transmitted and received polarization states.
Notation Format: TX/RX

First letter: Transmit polarization
Second letter: Receive polarization

HV Configuration:
Meaning:

H: Horizontally polarized energy transmitted
V: Vertically polarized energy received
This is cross-polarization (transmit and receive are orthogonal)

Physical Interpretation:

Transmitted wave has electric field oscillating horizontally
Only the vertically polarized component of scattered energy is recorded
This captures depolarization caused by the target

Why Cross-Pol Matters:
Causes of Depolarization:

Volume Scattering:

Multiple scattering within vegetation canopy
Randomly oriented elements (leaves, branches)
Rotates polarization randomly


Complex Surface Structures:

Rough surfaces with varying orientations
Urban buildings at various angles
Vegetation-ground interactions


Double-Bounce:

First bounce: H to V
Second bounce: V remains V (or H remains H)
Creates strong cross-pol return



Feature Sensitivity:
HH (co-pol):

Surface scattering
Horizontal structures
Ocean waves
Ice edges

VV (co-pol):

Surface scattering
Vertical structures
Trees
Stronger water penetration

HV or VH (cross-pol):

Volume scattering (forests, crops)
Rough surfaces
Urban areas (multiple bounces)
Minimal return from smooth surfaces (water)

Practical Applications:

Forest Biomass:

HV correlates with forest structure
Penetrates canopy, scatters from branches
Used in GEDI, BIOMASS missions


Crop Classification:

Different crops have different structure
Cross-pol ratios distinguish crops
Sensitive to crop growth stage


Urban Mapping:

Buildings create strong cross-pol
Differentiates urban from natural
Building orientation detection


Ice Monitoring:

Sea ice types have different depolarization
Multi-year vs. first-year ice
Ice deformation features


Wetland Detection:

Vegetation-water interactions
Strong HV from flooded vegetation
Distinguishes from open water (low HV)




Additional Important Concepts

Specular reflection
Strong in co-pol, weak in cross-pol
Example: calm water, roads, bare soil


Volume Scattering:

Multiple scattering within a medium
Randomizes polarization
Strong in cross-pol
Example: forest canopy, snow, dry sand


Double-Bounce:

Two reflections (e.g., ground-wall)
Preserves or changes polarization systematically
Very strong return
Example: urban areas, flooded vegetation



Geometric Distortions

Foreshortening:

Slopes facing radar compressed
Ground distance < image distance
Worse at steep incidence angles


Layover:

Top of tall features appears before base
Severe in mountains with steep incidence
Can completely obscure terrain


Shadow:

Areas blocked from radar illumination
No return signal
Occurs behind tall features away from radar



Solutions:

Use digital elevation models (DEM)
Orthorectification processing
Select appropriate incidence angles
Combine ascending/descending orbits
